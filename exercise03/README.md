# Exercise 03 – **OpenStreetMap Agent** 🌐🧭

In the previous session you learned how an **MCP server** exposes external
functionality (maps, …) and how to attach one to an agent.
Your mission: **implement `OpenStreetMapAgent`** so our assistant can answer
location-based questions (nearby places, route directions, etc.).

---

## 1 Learning goals

* Write an **async setup factory** for an agent.
* Interact with the **MCP repository** to obtain a server handle.
* Register the new agent as a **tool** inside a larger multi-agent system.

## 3 Tasks

### 3.1 `OpenStreetMapAgent.setup()`

1. Call the `get_instance()` on `MCPServerRepository` to obtain the singleton.
2. Retrieve the server with the key `openstreetmaps`.
3. Return `cls(...)` with
    * `name` - a meaningful agent name
    * `instructions` – one or two sentences describing its domain.
    * `tools` - the agent should still be able to think and ask for clarifications
    * `mcp_servers` - the retrieved MCPS server

### 3.2 Register the tool in **`triage_agent`**

- Use `asyncio.run` on the `setup` method to await the agent setup and then use the returned agent as a tool.
- Make sure to use a meaningful tool description and name
- You might want to use the inspector or call `list_tools` to see what tools the server offers. Alternatively, look it up on the GitHub repository. This will help you craft a better tool description.


### 3.3  Testing and refinement

- Test out the agent with different instructions
- Use different prompts and see if the agent performs better or worse

### 3.4  Bonus:
- Search for another MCP tool and add it to the agent

## 4 Hints

* `MCPServerRepository` is **already implemented** – no need to touch it.
* Remember that `setup()` is **async**, but you call it synchronously in
    `triage_agent` via `asyncio.run(...)`.
